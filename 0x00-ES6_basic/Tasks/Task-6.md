**6. Take advantage of template literals**

Rewrite the return statement to use a template literal so you can the substitute the variables youâ€™ve defined.

```js
export default function getSanFranciscoDescription() {
  const year = 2017;
  const budget = {
    income: '$119,868',
    gdp: '$154.2 billion',
    capita: '$178,479',
  };

  return 'As of ' + year + ', it was the seventh-highest income county in the United States'
        / ', with a per capita personal income of ' + budget.income + '. As of 2015, San Francisco'
        / ' proper had a GDP of ' + budget.gdp + ', and a GDP per capita of ' + budget.capita + '.';
}
```
**Execution:**

```sh
bob@dylan:~$ cat 6-main.js
import getSanFranciscoDescription from './6-string-interpolation.js';

console.log(getSanFranciscoDescription());

bob@dylan:~$
bob@dylan:~$ npm run dev 6-main.js
